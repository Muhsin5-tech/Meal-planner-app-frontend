# Meal Planner App - README
# Overview
This Meal Planner App is a full-stack web application that allows users to plan meals for the week. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for meals and day plans. Users can add meals with ingredients, instructions, and an image URL, then assign those meals to specific days of the week. It also supports editing and deleting meals and day plans.

The application is built using React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and SQLAlchemy for database management.
